-You basically want to copy the momentum extension in terms of design - main content dead center with links to about and social media/source on the right and left top corners respectively
-You'll use the minima theme(already installed) and tweak its scss

FUNCTIONALITY
---
-You'll eventually want to build in a search functionality with algolia

BUILD PROCESS
---
-You'll want to find out how to create many posts quickly with a shell command
-You can mine the data from the a-z guide with a python web scraper

You may also want to find a different, non-posts method to pull in data for the commands. Currently you hae ~600 commands and 365 days in the year. 
You also don't want them to be displayed randomly. You want them to be ordered randomly but appear in a set order.
