BASIC USAGE
---
"jekyll serve" from the cli will spawn your dev env at localhost:4000/linux-command-advent-calendar

DESIGN
---
-Take design cues from sites found on jekyllthemes.org
-You basically want to copy the momentum extension in terms of design - main content dead center with links to about and social media/source on the right and left top corners respectively
-You'll use the minima theme(already installed) and tweak its scss
-About page is a modal that dims the rest of the page and displays its content overtop
-About button itself morphs into an X to close the About content(perhaps done with CSS animations)

FUNCTIONALITY
---
-You'll eventually want to build in a search functionality with Algolia.
-Consider building an accompanying API of all the linux commands used. The API would include a way to output the linux command of the day.
-Consider having an email service that users can subscribe to to get the day's command

BUILD PROCESS
---
-You can mine the data from the a-z guide with a python web scraper
-Make sure to use the minima theme docs as reference

DONE
---
-Bash script to create many posts quickly
